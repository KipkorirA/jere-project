        "Business Problem\n",
        "The real estate market is characterized by significant information asymmetry. Buyers and renters often lack the expertise and market visibility needed to determine whether a listed property price reflects its true market value. At the same time, sellers and agents may unintentionally overprice or underprice properties due to reliance on intuition, incomplete comparable listings, or outdated market information.\n",
        "\n",
        "These pricing inefficiencies can result in prolonged time on the market, failed negotiations, financial losses, and reduced trust in the housing market. The problem is especially pronounced in urban housing markets, where property prices vary widely based on location, size, condition, and amenities, making accurate price evaluation difficult for non-expert participants.\n",
        "\n",
        "Proposed Solution\n",
        "This project proposes a machine learning–based pricing intelligence system that learns market pricing patterns from historical real estate data. The model estimates the expected market value of a property based on its characteristics and compares this estimate to the property’s listed price.\n",
        "\n",
        "Based on this comparison, the system flags pricing anomalies and classifies properties as:\n",
        "\n",
        "Underpriced\n",
        "Fairly priced\n",
        "Overpriced\n",
        "This approach provides an objective, data-driven benchmark for evaluating property prices, reducing reliance on subjective judgment.\n",
        "\n",
        "Business Objective\n",
        "The objective of this project is to develop a supervised machine learning model that accurately predicts a property’s expected market value and uses this prediction to identify potential mispricing in real estate listings. The tool is designed to support informed decision-making rather than replace professional valuation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Business Value\n",
        "This solution delivers value to multiple stakeholders:\n",
        "\n",
        "Buyers & Renters\n",
        "Helps users identify good deals, avoid overpriced properties, and negotiate more effectively, reducing financial risk.\n",
        "\n",
        "Sellers & Property Owners\n",
        "Assists in setting competitive prices that reduce time on market while maximizing returns.\n",
        "\n",
        "Real Estate Agents & PropTech Platforms\n",
        "Provides objective, data-backed pricing insights that enhance credibility, user trust, and pricing transparency.\n",
        "\n",
        "Policy Makers & Urban Planning Analysts (Future Use)\n",
        "Can be extended to analyze housing affordability, spatial price disparities, and structural inefficiencies in urban housing markets.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Develop an accurate property valuation model – Build a machine learning model that predicts the expected market value of residential and commercial properties based on key features such as location, size, type, and amenities.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Detect pricing anomalies in real estate listings – Use the predicted market values to identify and flag properties as fairly priced, overpriced, or underpriced to support informed decision-making.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Enhance market transparency for stakeholders – Provide buyers, sellers, renters, and agents with actionable insights to reduce information asymmetry and promote fair, data-driven pricing in housing markets.\n",
